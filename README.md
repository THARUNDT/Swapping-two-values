# Swapping-two-values
## AIM:
To write a python program for swapping of two values
## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED: 
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## ALGORITHM: 
### Step 1:
Get the two values from the user
### Step 2: 
Assign the value of second variable to a temporary variable 
### Step 3: 
Assign the value of the first variable to the second variable.
### Step 4:  
Assign the value in temporary variable to the first variable
### Step 5: 
Print both the values it would be interchanged
### Step 6: 
End the program
## PROGRAM:
# Program to find the distance between two points.

import math
x1=4
x2=10
y1=2
y2=6
distance=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
print(round(distance,2))
